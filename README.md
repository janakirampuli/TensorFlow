## General Information
- This projects helps to understand basics of Machine Learning using TensorFlow, Keras Library.
- Linear regression is one of the most basic forms of machine learning and is used to predict numeric values. In this we will use a linear model to predict the survival rate of passangers from the titanic dataset.
- Classification is used to seperate data points into classes of different labels. In this example we will use a TensorFlow estimator to classify flowers.
- In Neural Networks we can learn how to create and use a neural network to classify articles of clothing. To achieve this, we will use a sub module of TensorFlow called keras.
- In Computer Vision we will learn how to peform image classification and object detection/recognition using deep computer vision with something called a convolutional neural network.
- In Natural Language Processing we will be introduced to a new kind of neural network that is much more capable of processing sequential data such as text or characters called a recurrent neural network (RNN for short).
